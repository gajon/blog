This is a book targeted to people (more specifically, programmers) who are
thinking about starting a software business, or are working in a startup
or small software business.

The author is the founder of SourceGear, an Illinois based company which
develops and sells version control tools for developers, and through his
own experiences he shows us the lessons he has learned; many times by
making a *lot* of mistakes.

The book is divided in four parts; (1) Entrepreneurship, (2) People, (3)
Marketing, and (4) Sales. In each part the author answers the most common
questions most developers have when thinking about becoming an
entrepreneur.

He also tries to demystify many topics that are nebulous and obscure to
most programmers, especially the ones that relate to marketing, sales and
finances. He shows us that these topics are not as complex as they may
seem and he even provides us with *algorithms* that we can use to better
understand them.

The nice thing about this book is that the author, not being a
*"business"* person, but a programmer at heart, writes from that
perspective, making it easy to relate to him, and see that he had the same
questions, self-doubts and fears that most programmers have.

The content of this book is taken from blog articles the author has
published on his own website, with some comments added at the beginning of
each one. This means that (1) you could read everything on his web site
(though I prefer reading from a book), and (2) there is some repetition of
ideas that were said in a previous article.

Highly recommended reading if you have dreams of starting your own
software business someday.
