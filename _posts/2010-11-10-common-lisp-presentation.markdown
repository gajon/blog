title: Common Lisp presentation at the HackerRoom MX
---

The [HackerRoom MX][] is a co-working space for hackers in Mexico City. I
gave a Common Lisp talk this last September to a few of the inhabitants
there.

I'm putting the slides at [http://gajon.org/otherstuff/lisp-slides/][slides]

If you are creating a similar presentation feel free to take whatever you
want from my slides. **I hereby authorize You to do whatever the hell you
want with the content referred to above**. Except that I took some parts from
other places (always showing a link to the original source). If you use
something from those parts you should include the link to the original
sources as well.

Enjoy.
