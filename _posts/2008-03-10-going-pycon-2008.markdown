title: Going to PyCon 2008
---

There's only 4 days left before I fly to Chicago to attend the 
[PyCon 2008][] conference, the biggest event for the [Python][] community.
This will be the second time that I go to PyCon, [last year][] the
conference was held in Addison Texas and I really had a great time, I met
cool people, visited a few restaurants and learned interesting things
about Python.

Here are some photos that I took last year, and you can see more on my
[flickr set][]:

I'm sure this year's PyCon will be great!

It's nice to meet intelligent people and be surrounded by all this
enthusiasm around this cool language and all the projects that are being
built with it.
