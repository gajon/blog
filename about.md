# About

Hello, I'm Jorge and I currently live in Mexico City. I've been working as a
software developer for over 20 years, and during this time I've gained
experience with different programming languages and paradigms. From writing
Bluetooth protocols in embedded devices to desktop applications, to web
applications.

In the past I've worked with C, C++, Java, PHP, Python, Perl, Common Lisp, and
more recently with Javascript and Ruby. Overall my absolute favorites are
Common Lisp and Ruby, and I've been working mostly with Ruby for the last 11
years.

The type of work I specialize on is backend development, following TDD
practices with a focus on scalable designs with clean and good OOP techniques.
If you need help either building an MVP for your business idea, or grow your
current project while reducing code complexity, let's talk!
